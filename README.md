Advent of Code solutions in Java 25

## Goals

* Try to solve with the "script" feature of Java 25.
* Each days should run less then 1 sec (for both parts together; exclduing JVM start)
* All days should run less then 10 sec (???? Yeah, I usually aim for this, but usually, it is twice as many days... I dunno... mayba decrease after the event...)
* Each solution should run simply as `java DayXY.java` (Where XY is `\d{2}`.)
* No external library, just pure Java 25.
* +1 I want to write all codes before the nextone comes out. I used to try to finish them before I have to go to work, but it is not realistic any more...
